            The game also is auto-resizable! The game was developed in resolution <strong>1280x720px (HD)</strong>. You can use any size in height and width, but it gets better in the original resolution. Another suggestion is <strong>860x480px</strong> resolution.

            </div>
          	<div id="contentTxt">
			There are 2 types of games ready. The normal version and the iframe version.
			<br>
            <br>
            <div id="contentMiniTitle">
            Version normal
            </div>
            The normal version is full, fullscreen display. She fills the entire browser screen. If you want this version on your site, follow the steps below:
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/img_game_01.jpg">
            <br>
            <br>
			- Copy the "version_normal" folder to your server. Feel free to change the folder name.
            <br>
			- If the game is open on your phone, or tablet, and the screen is rotated in the wrong position, will appear an error message. Thus, the player will rotate the device to the correct position.
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="contentMiniTitle">
            Version iframe
            </div>
            If you prefer the game to appear embedded in your website, it is best to use the iframe version. So you can use a menu on top, or even a banner. 
			<br>
            <br>
			The folder with the iframe version is this: 
			<br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/img_game_02.jpg">
            <br>
            <br>
			If you want to change the page with iframes, follow the steps below:
            <br>
            <br>
			- Copy the folder with the game to your server. Decorate the directory name, because you'll need to put in the iframe.
            <br>
			- On the page that you want the game to appear, copy the following code in html:
			<br>
            <br>
            <strong>
			&lt;iframe src=&quot;gamefolder/index.html&quot; width=&quot;860px&quot; height=&quot;480px&quot;&gt; &lt;/ iframe&gt;
            </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
			- Where is "gamefolder" you put the entire directory to where you put the game on your server, example: <strong>"games/adventure/myhero"</strong>.
            <br>
			- If you want to change the size of the game will appear on your website, simply modify the "width" and "height". You can use whatever size you want, because the game will adjust alone.
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="contentMiniTitle">
            Iframe size recommended
            </div>
            The game is fully resizable, and you can use any size in the iframe. But I recommend the original resolution: 
			<br>
            <br>
            <strong>1280x720px</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
			If you want to use another size, try decreasing in proportion. Another size that is very good this is (this resolution attached):
			<br>
            <br>
            <strong>860x480px</strong>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <hr>
        
        <div id="content">
            <div id="Editingimages">
            </div>
            <div id="contentTitle">
            D) Editing images - 
            <a class="top" href="#Top">Top</a>
            </div>
            <div id="contentTxt">
			To edit the images of the game, no need to leave the program. Just replace them. Follow the steps below.
            <br>
            <br>
            The pictures are in this directory: <strong>/game/images</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/img_images_01.jpg">
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Make sure the image you want to replace has the same dimensions of the original.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/img_images_02.jpg">
            <br>
            <br>
            - Always save in PNG, because if you save as jpeg, it will not work, because it lacks transparency.
            <br>
            - Replace the original image you created.
            <br>
            - Okay, now try the game!
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Important: You should always make a backup before editing, because you may want to recover the original file.</strong>

            <br>
            <br>
			If the mobile version, you must delete the buttons in the layout. Just open the Construct file, search for and delete buttons.
